## Generic Fuzzy Finder for Unity Editor

Unifind is just a simple way to fuzzy-select from a list of items from inside a Unity editor script.

Usage
---

After adding to your project, by default you can open the fuzzy window either with `alt+d` or by selecting `Window` -> `General` -> `Fuzzy Finder`, after which you should see this popup:

<img src="screenshot.png?raw=true" alt="Unifind Screenshot"/>

From there, you can enter text to match against the list of actions that have been added.
